# 👋 **Hello, I'm Enver!**

I’m a student at **Ecole 42** and a university in Istanbul, passionate about coding and constantly seeking to learn and improve my skills. I enjoy taking on challenges and continuously improving my skills, particularly in C and C++ . Here, you’ll find some of my personal projects, ranging from low-level programming to web development.

*Imagine if the only programming language in the world was C. Wouldn't that be great?*
